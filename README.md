- You can choose to take one time test or run 3/5 tests in a row and get average reaction time.
- Lighting logo dissapears from the screen, program then waits random amount of seconds before lightning reappears in random place of the screen.
- Reaction time is taken from the time lightning reappears on screen and enter key is pressed by user.
